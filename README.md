# Search-Engine
This a multi-threaded Search Engine server I made in C/C++ for my Systems Programming class in Fall 2024. It includes my implementation for everything we worked on throughout the quarter, from Linked List and Hash Table to actual usable server. All of the code I wrote follows the Google C/C++ style guide and was strictly linted.

I wrote code in the following files:
1. LinkedList.c
2. HashTable.c
3. CrawlFileTree.c
4. DocTable.c
5. FileParser.c
6. MemIndex.c
7. DocIDTableReader.cc
8. DocTableReader.cc
9. HashTableReader.cc
10. FileIndexReader.cc
11. IndexTableReader.cc
12. QueryProcessor.cc
13. WriteIndex.cc
14. FileReader.cc
15. ServerSocket.cc
16. HttpConnection.cc
17. http333d.cc
18. HttpServer.cc
19. HttpUtils.cc
